<p>My name is Eric Wong. I am 45 years old. I live in Tustin, CA, with my wife and two kids.</p>

On the other hand, I'm not a big fan of *italics*.

And here is a combination of both ***bold and italics***. I am increasing the length of this sentence. How long can it go?

To quote Hamlet:

>"To be or not to be, that is the question."

Instructions for dancing:
1. Jump down
2. Turnaround
3. Pick a bale of cotton
