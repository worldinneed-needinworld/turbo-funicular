Overall, The Trade Desk is a good choice for advertisers who are looking for an independent DSP with a strong focus on technology and transparency. It is also a good choice for advertisers who want to buy digital advertising space in real time, across a variety of devices and channels.

Amazon, Google, Meta, and Mediaocean are all good choices for advertisers who are looking for a comprehensive advertising platform that offers a wide range of features. However, it is important to note that these companies are not independent DSPs. This means that they may have their own interests in mind when recommending advertising campaigns to their customers.

Quantcast is a good choice for advertisers who are looking for a DSP that is focused on data-driven advertising. Quantcast has a large database of audience data that can be used to target ads more effectively.
